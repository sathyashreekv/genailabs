        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The Gradio library was successfully installed (or its existing presence confirmed) in the environment.\n",
        "*   Necessary libraries, including `pipeline` from `transformers` and `gradio`, were imported. A pre-trained sentiment analysis model (default `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) was loaded using `pipeline(\"sentiment-analysis\")`.\n",
        "*   A Python function `sentiment_predictor` was defined, which takes text as input, uses the loaded sentiment analysis pipeline, and returns the sentiment's label and score.\n",
        "*   A Gradio web interface, `sentiment_interface`, was designed using `gr.Interface`. It linked the `sentiment_predictor` function to a `gr.Textbox` for text input and displayed the output as a `gr.Textbox` for the sentiment label and a `gr.Number` for the sentiment score.\n",
        "*   The Gradio interface was successfully launched using `sentiment_interface.launch()`, providing a public URL for access, indicating the application is live and operational.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The established Gradio interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with the sentiment analysis model, making it accessible for non-technical users.\n",
        "*   Further enhancements could involve integrating custom sentiment models, adding more advanced UI components for batch processing, or deploying the application to a permanent hosting solution.\n"
